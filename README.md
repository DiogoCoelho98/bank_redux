# Introduction to React-Redux - Bank App

This project serves as an introduction to React-Redux by developing a small bank app. Initially, I implemented the traditional React-Redux approach, which involves manually creating and combining reducers in the store. I also utilized action creator functions, providing flexibility for each dispatched action. Additionally, I integrated Redux Thunks, allowing for middleware to handle asynchronous operations between the action creator functions and the store.

Afterward, I transitioned to the modern method using @reduxjs/toolkit, which simplifies many aspects of Redux development. This approach reduces boilerplate, streamlines store configuration, and enhances code readability.
